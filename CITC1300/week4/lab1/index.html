    <h3>History of Gaming</h3>
      <p>Video games began in the late 1940's to the early 1950's, but became mainstream in the 1970's and 1980's. This is when arcade video games, gaming consoles and home computer games were introduced to the general public. Video games have become a popular form of entertainment in most parts of the world. The first interactive electronic game with an electronic display was in 1947. During this time there was a wide range of devices and inventions  with large advances in computing technology, and the "Video Game"was invented.</p>
       
      <p> PC and console gamers both want the most bang for their buck, and how it's measured is different for each group. For a console gamer, costs are generally limited to purchasing the console, extra controllers, games, and perhaps online multiplayer passes. For a PC gamer, there's a wide variety of options to buy if you choose to build your own computer, and not every PC gamer has their own custom-built machine.</p>

      <p>There is such a wide variety of possibilities and differences in perceived value, it's impossible to say either PCs or consoles are more cost-efficient. It completely depends on the individual. The level of customization and performance you're looking for determines the size your budget needs to be to get the platform you want.</p>
